### Hi there 👋

I'm Balazs - a 19 yr old Software Engineer from Budapest 🇭🇺, currently working at Booking.com in Manchester 🐝. 

🏗️ I love building things, and I've found programming to be the lowest common denominator that allows me to express my creativity in the digital age.

## Exciting stuff I'm working on:  
💳 [**Conce**](https://github.com/conce-io) – Accept both PayPal and Stripe payments in just a few lines of code.  
🕰️ [**Await**](https://getawait.com) – A beautifully crafted open-source waitlist management system

There's a ton more ideas in the works, so watch this space 😊

## Favourite techonologies
I'd consider myself to be a Full-stack developer, and so there's a great variety of unrelated technologies here.

🥇 **Laravel**: By far my favourite piece of software, an absolute pleasure to work with. The very fact that its so opinionated guides you through development at a blazing pace. Staggeringly large ecosystem too!  
🥈 **React + TypeScript**: Whilst React is great on its own, any codebase's maintainability skyrockets with the use of TypeScript.  
🥉 **Tailwindcss**: Before Tailwind, I've absolutely despised writing CSS. Yet due to how tightly coupled it is to DOM elements, not only does styling become super-fast, but it also forces you to abstract commonly used sets of elements into standalone components.

Honouranble mentions: Symfony – great for large-scale PHP projects, Vue.js – great drop-in alternative to React for pre-existing projects, Next.js – I'm sorry, but it's just so much easier than Gatsby.
