### Hi there 👋
![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/heeyitsbalazs?style=social)

I'm Balazs - a 19 yr old Software Engineer from Budapest 🇭🇺, currently working at Booking.com in Manchester 🐝. 

🏗️ I love building things, and I've found programming to be the lowest common denominator that allows me to express my creativity in the digital age.

## Exciting stuff I'm working on:  
🕰️ [**Await**](https://getawait.com) – A beautifully crafted open-source waitlist management system  
🎮 [**Avatag**](https://avatag.hu) – Gameserver hosting built with simplicity and ease-of-use above all *(only available in Hungarian for now)*

There's a ton more ideas in the works, so watch this space 😊
